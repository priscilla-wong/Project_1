## Analysis: The effects of COVID-19 on the US Economy (Real estate, Personal Consumption Expenditure, and Unemployent)


# Hypothesis 1: Unemployment rates increase as the death count from COVID-19 cases increases
# Findings and conclusions:


# Hypothesis 2: Personal Consumption Expenditure will decrease proportionally relative to the COVID-19 Case count
# Findings and conclusions:
# There is only a weak positive correlation between total COVID cases to personal consumption expenditure from January 2020 through February 2021 (0.299979). The correlation between average new cases per month versus personal expenditure is about 0.303807.
# The only month where there was a huge dip in personal consumption was April 2020. Expenditure was $12,112,058 (in Millions). However, the majority of the months remained around 14 billion and was largely unaffected by the rising case count toward the end of the year. Even in Dec 2020 at the highest case count, the expenditure was still at around 14 billion.


# Hypothesis 3: Real estate listings decrease as case counts increase.
