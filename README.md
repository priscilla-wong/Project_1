## Analysis: The effects of COVID-19 on the US Economy (Real estate, Personal Consumption Expenditure, and Unemployent)


### Hypothesis 1: Unemployment rates increase as the death count from COVID-19 cases increases
#### Findings and conclusions:
##### There is a fairly strong positive correlation between total COVID deaths to unemployment expenditure from January 2020 through December 2020 (0.747861). 
##### April 2020 is clearly when the effects of COVID were more inpactuful on jobs across all sectors in the US. From that point on we can appreciate a steadily decrease of the unemployment rate from 14.8% in April to a more moderate 6.7% in December.


### Hypothesis 2: Personal Consumption Expenditure will decrease proportionally relative to the COVID-19 Case count
#### Findings and conclusions:
##### There is only a weak positive correlation between total COVID cases to personal consumption expenditure from January 2020 through February 2021 (0.299979). The correlation between average new cases per month versus personal expenditure is about 0.303807.
##### The only month where there was a huge dip in personal consumption was April 2020. Expenditure was $12,112,058 (in Millions). However, the majority of the months remained around 14 billion and was largely unaffected by the rising case count toward the end of the year. Even in Dec 2020 at the highest case count, the expenditure was still at around 14 billion.


### Hypothesis 3: Real estate listings decrease as case counts increase.
#### Findings and conclusions:
Real estate listings and prices increased as a result of the CDC and government shelter in place guidelines and work from home policies. Since most of the general population had to convert their homes into schools, offices, gym, home restaurants and lounging places, there was a dire need to expand the existing territories to accomodate all the new changes. ![housing demand](https://rdceconomics.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/f-B-40022-Hottest-Zips-2020-scaled.jpg)
Another policy put in place was the eviction moratorium which shields home owners and renters from foreclosures and evictions. This has since caused a significant rise in the nationwide mortgage debt.
